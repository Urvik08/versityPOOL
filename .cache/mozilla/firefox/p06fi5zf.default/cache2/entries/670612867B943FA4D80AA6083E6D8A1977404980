[{"title":"Upgrading to Rails 5 Beta - The Hard Way","content":"\u003cp\u003eRails 5 has been brewing for more than a year. To take advantage of new features, and stay on the supported path, you\u0026#39;ll need to upgrade. In this post, we\u0026#39;ll look at the upgrade process for a production Rails app, \u003ca href=\"http://www.codetriage.com\"\u003ecodetriage.com\u003c/a\u003e. The codebase is open source so you \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage/pull/435\"\u003ecan follow along\u003c/a\u003e. Special thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/_cha1tanya\"\u003ePrathamesh\u003c/a\u003e for his help with this blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 class='anchored'\u003e\n  \u003ca name='how-stable-is-the-beta' href='#how-stable-is-the-beta'\u003eHow Stable is the Beta?\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Rails a beta means the API is not yet stable, and features will come and go. A Release Candidate (RC) means no new features; the API is considered stable, and RCs will continue to be released until all reported regressions are resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShould you run your production app on the beta? There is value in getting a beta working on a branch and being ready when the RC or upcoming release is available. Lots of companies run Beta and RC releases of Rails in production, but it\u0026#39;s not for the faint of heart. You\u0026#39;ll need to be pretty confident in your app, make sure your test suite is up to par, and that manual quality control (QC) checks are thorough. It\u0026#39;s always a relief to find and fix bugs before they arrive in production. Please report regressions and bugs you encounter -- the faster we uncover and report them, the faster these bugs get fixed, and the more stable Rails becomes. Remember, no one else is going to find and report the regressions in your codebase unless you do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":["rails5","upgrade","beta","ruby","rails"],"published_at":"2016-01-22T18:25:26.057Z","permalink":"http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/1/22/rails-5-beta-upgrade"},{"title":"Here's Postgres 9.5: Now Available on Heroku","content":"\u003cp\u003eHeroku has long been committed to making PostgreSQL one of the best relational databases in the world. Weâ€™re also committed to giving you the ability to try the latest release as soon as itâ€™s available. Today, weâ€™re pleased to announce the public beta of Postgres 9.5 on Heroku. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1636/\"\u003ePostgreSQL 9.5\u003c/a\u003e brings a bevy of super exciting new features with the most prominent being the new UPSERT functionality. UPSERT gives you the expected behavior of an insert, or, if there is a conflict, an update, and is performant without the risk of race conditions for your data. UPSERT was one of the last few detracting arguments against PostgreSQL. A special thanks goes to Peter Geoghegan on the Heroku Postgres team for committing the better part of two years developing the functionality as its primary author, along with contributions from Andres Freund from \u003ca href=\"https://www.citusdata.com/\"\u003eCitus Data\u003c/a\u003e and Heikki Linnakangas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can get started right now with PostgreSQL 9.5 on Heroku by passing in the version flag during a provision request:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql --version=9.5\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis lets customers who want to try out the new release an easy way to do so, while customers who are happy with the current version can stay on 9.4 until 9.5 matures and we make it generally available. New databases will continue to default to 9.4. \u003c/p\u003e\n","tags":["postgres","postgres 9.5","upsert"],"published_at":"2016-01-07T23:50:49.753Z","permalink":"http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/1/7/postgres-95-now-available-on-heroku"},{"title":"The Heroku 2015 Retrospective","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs we start this New Year, we wanted to give you a recap of our 2015, a year filled with a lot of new products and features.

With this beta, Heroku now supports the current and most widely supported SSO standard known as SAML 2.0, and has partnered with leading identity providers (IdPs) for easy set-up.  Customers can use their existing identity provider like \u003ca href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/platform/products/identity/\"\u003eSalesforce Identity\u003c/a\u003e, Okta, PingOne, Microsoft Active Directory, and PingFederate for their employees\u0026#39; single sign-on to \u003ca href=\"https://www.heroku.com/enterprise\"\u003eHeroku Enterprise\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://heroku-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/1450315053-App%20Launcher.png\" alt=\"SSO for Heroku using Salesforce Identity as IdP\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSSO is expected to be generally available in early February.  Initially, it will be available to Heroku Enterprise customers.  For enterprise customers who want to use the feature during the beta period, it is now available in the \u0026quot;Settings\u0026quot; tab of their Heroku org.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve worked hard to make the set up easy (a few minutes in most cases), yet flexible enough to robustly support less common or home-grown IdPs.  Connecting existing identity solutions to Heroku is straightforward for identity administrators, as is setting up a new IdP with Heroku.  End-users are presented with a guided two-step upgrade path to SSO when they are added to the IdP, and new user accounts are auto-provisioned in real-time based on the IdP authentication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are also partnering with major identity providers to build Heroku support into their products.  So for leading IdPs -- like Salesforce Identity, Okta, PingOne, and PingFederate --  set-up for system administrators can be as easy as adding Heroku as a known and supported \u0026quot;service provider,\u0026quot; and providing the Heroku organization name.  In a few clicks both the IdP and Heroku will be fully set up and ready for test, and then for easy deployment to the entire company.   Other popular cloud-based IdPs will be launching built-in support for Heroku in the first quarter of 2016.  All operate with the high level of security and reliability Heroku customers have come to expect from our products and partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, SSO for Heroku fully supports Microsoft\u0026#39;s Active Directory.  SSO support in Heroku also works well with minimal but manual set-up for most other SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHeroku Enterprise customers who would like to be part of the beta can start now.
